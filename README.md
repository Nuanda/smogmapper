# Smogmapper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nuanda/smogmapper.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Nuanda/smogmapper)

SmogMapper is an air quality monitoring service. It gathers realtime readings from a distributed network of
sensors, that measure things like particulate matter (PM). SmogMapper stores that data and presents it to the
public, in an efficient way.

Currently, the service is developed by the following contributors:
* [Tomasz Gubała](https://github.com/Nuanda) - the main developer
* [Marek Kasztelnik](https://github.com/mkasztelnik)
* [Tomasz Szymczyszyn](https://github.com/kammerer)
* [Piotr Nowakowski](https://github.com/nowakowski)

Initially, SmogMapper was developed during [Smogathon 2015](http://www.smogathon.pl/), where it won the first
prize. The original SmogMapper Smogathon team:
* Paweł Gesing
* Tomasz Gubała
* Michał Kiełtyka
* Damian Kinski
* Robert Siemiński
