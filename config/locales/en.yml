      It's a demonstration version of what was designed, developed and deployed
      during <a href='http://www.smogathon.pl/'>Smogathon 2015</a>. It shows temperature,
      humidity and particulate matter reading data from the sensor we have built.
      It also demonstrates visualization of 340 of such sensors, if one would deploy them
      throughout the city of Kraków, Poland.

      Please click a sensor marker on the map, in order to get the readings. The bigger marker
      in Zabłocie district shows the real readings from the sensor we have constructed. All
      other readings are just a demonstration.

      Please also use the Particulate matter button below to see a dynamic map of the
      phenomenon, simulated for 340 sensors.

    disclaimer: |
      <strong>NOTE</strong>: please note the presented data is generated for the purpose
      of the demonstration, so it in no way shows the actual air quality (apart from the
      single, bigger, marker, that represents the real sensor we have built and integrated in).
      The real sensor data was recorded on 13th of December, 2015, indoors.
