      It's a demonstration version of what was designed, developed and deployed
      during <a href='http://www.smogathon.pl/'>Smogathon 2015</a>. It shows temperature,
      humidity and particulate matter reading data from the sensor we have built.
      It also demonstrates visualization of 340 of such sensors, if one would deploy them
      throughout the city of Kraków, Poland.
