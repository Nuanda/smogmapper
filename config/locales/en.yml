      what_you_see: |
        The SmogMapper project aims at designing and testing the measurement quality of inexpensive dust
        sensors (and, perhaps, other air pollutants, in the future). The core idea is to have a lot
        of cheap, yet fully automated, particulate matter detectors, in order to validate their readings
        against the reference air quality monitoring stations of
        <a href='http://www.krakow.pios.gov.pl/'>Wojewódzki Inspektorat Ochrony Środowiska (WIOŚ)</a>
        (a regional environment protection authority). We predict that a dense network of such inexpensive
        devices, despite the fact of lower accuracy of a single reading, will provide us with fresh and
        valuable insights as to the nature and the dynamics of the smog phenomenon.
#        This system shows measurements of air quality, gathered through a distributed network of
#        automated sensors. Depending on a sensor type, we publish readings of particulate matter
#        density (in various molecule sizes), air temperature and relative humidity.
      what_you_see_2: |
        Please click a sensor marker on the map, in order to get the readings. You are also able to
        load a reference data in the same air quality chart - the reference data comes from the air
        quality measurement stations deployed by WIOŚ (this function is there mainly for sensor diagnostics).
        The magenta markers represent reference air quality stations - the readings for those stations
        are loaded from <a href='http://monitoring.krakow.pios.gov.pl/'>the official air quality monitoring service</a>.
      disclaimer: |
        The first SmogMapper version was created during the <a href='http://www.smogathon.pl/'>Smogathon 2015</a>,
        where it won the first prize. SmogMapper is currently still in its early stage of implementation and
        testing - hence the small amount of registered sensors, and occasional discontinuity in readings.

    demo:
      what_you_see: |
        It's a demonstration version of what was designed, developed and deployed
        during <a href='http://www.smogathon.pl/'>Smogathon 2015</a>. It shows temperature,
        humidity and particulate matter reading data from the sensor we have built.
        It also demonstrates visualization of 340 of such sensors, if one would deploy them
        throughout the city of Kraków, Poland.
      what_you_see_2: |
        Please click a sensor marker on the map, in order to get the readings. The bigger marker
        in Zabłocie district shows the real readings from the sensor we have constructed. All
        other readings are just a demonstration.

        Please also use the Particulate matter button below to see a dynamic map of the
        phenomenon, simulated for 340 sensors.
      disclaimer: |
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: please note the presented data is generated for the purpose
        of the demonstration, so it in no way shows the actual air quality (apart from the
        single, bigger, marker, that represents the real sensor we have built and integrated in).
        The real sensor data was recorded on 13th of December, 2015, indoors.

    instruction: |
      Please provide below the geolocalization of the sensor and type in the sensor identification
      token, that was supplied to you. You may also name the sensor, if you like, but please be polite ;).
    geo: |
      Latitude and longitude should be provided in degrees and fraction of degrees (e.g. 50.0484 or
      19.9599) - please keep at least the 4-digit precision, it's important. The height (altitude above the ground level)
      should be provided as a rough number of meters above the ground level. Precision up to a full meter is sufficient.
